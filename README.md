Field ecologist who likes to code.  
My work is focused on ecosystem gas fluxes in alpine and arctic ecosystems, and the effect of global changes on those.
I developped the [fluxible R package](https://plant-functional-trait-course.github.io/fluxible/) to process ecosystem gas flux data in a reproducible and efficient way.
Combining my experience as a military leader, field scientist, scout leader and outdoor sports regular, I started the [BIOutside platform](https://bioutside.w.uib.no/) to provide guidelines for safe and inclusive fieldwork.
When not at work, you might find me going up and down mountains.
